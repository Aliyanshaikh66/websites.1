                <b>Pakistan</b>(Urdu: <b>پاکِستان</b>[pakistan]),[d] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan <b>(اِسلامی جمہوریہ پاکِستان)</b> is a country in South Asia. It is the world's fifth-most populous country, 
                with a population of almost 243 million people, and has the world's second-largest Muslim population just behind Indonesia.[18] Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country in the world by area 
                and 2nd largest in South Asia, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). It has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south, 
                and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the northeast. It is separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor 
                in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. Islamabad is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre.

                Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Balochistan,[19] the Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age, 
                the most extensive of the civilisations of the Afro-Eurasia,[20][21] and the ancient Gandhara civilization.[22] The region that comprises the modern state of Pakistan was the 
                realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid; briefly that of Alexander the Great; the Seleucid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;[23] the Umayyad Caliphate 
                in its southern regions, the Hindu Shahis, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals,[24] the Durranis, the Sikh Empire, British East India Company rule, and most recently, 
                the British Indian Empire from 1858 to 1947.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spurred by the Pakistan Movement, which sought a homeland for the Muslims of British India, and election victories in 1946 by the All-India Muslim League, Pakistan gained independence 
                in 1947 after the Partition of the British Indian Empire, which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied by an unparalleled mass migration and loss 
                of life.[25] Initially a Dominion of the British Commonwealth, Pakistan officially drafted its constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared Islamic republic. In 1971, the exclave of 
                East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after a nine-month-long civil war. In the following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments whose descriptions, although 
                complex, commonly alternated between civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist.[26] Pakistan elected a civilian government in 2008, and in 2010 
                adopted a parliamentary system with periodic elections.[27]

                Pakistan is a middle power nation,[28][29][30][31][32][33] and has the world's sixth-largest standing armed forces. It is a declared nuclear-weapons state, and is ranked amongst the emerging 
                and growth-leading economies,[34] with a large and rapidly-growing middle class.[35] Pakistan's political history since independence has been characterised by periods of significant economic 
                and military growth as well as those of political and economic instability. It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. The country 
                continues to face challenges, including poverty, illiteracy, corruption and terrorism.[36] Pakistan is a member of the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation 
                of Islamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism Coalition, and is designated as a major 
                non-NATO ally by the United States.

                <b>Karachi</b> (/kəratʃi/; Urdu: کراچی; Sindhi: ڪراچي; IPA: [kəratʃi] (listen)) is the most populous city in Pakistan and 12th most populous city in the world, with a population of over 20 million.
                [18][19][20] It is situated at the southern tip of the country along the Arabian Sea coast. It is the former capital of Pakistan and capital of the province of Sindh. Ranked as a 
                beta-global city,[21][22] it is Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre,[23] with an estimated GDP of over $200 billion (PPP) as of 2021.[16][17] Karachi paid $9billion (25% of whole country) 
                as tax during fiscal year July 2021 to May 2022 according to FBR report. Karachi is Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city, linguistically, ethnically, and religiously diverse,[24] as well as one of 
                Pakistan's most secular and socially liberal cities.[25][26][27] Karachi serves as a transport hub, and contains Pakistans two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port Qasim, as well as 
                Pakistan's busiest airport, Jinnah International Airport.[28] Karachi is also a media center, home to news channels, film and fashion industry of Pakistan. Most of Pakistan's multinational companies 
                and banks have their headquarters in Karachi. Karachi is also a tourism hub due to its scenic beaches, historic buildings and shopping malls.

                The region has been inhabited for millennia,[29] but the city was formally founded as the fortified village of Kolachi as recently as 1729.[30][31] The settlement greatly increased in importance on arrival 
                of the East India Company in the mid-19th century. British administrators embarked on substantial projects to transform the city into a major seaport, and connect it with the extensive railway network of 
                the Indian subcontinent.[31] At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000 people.[24] Following the independence of Pakistan, the 
                city experienced a dramatic shift in population and demography with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muhajir (Urdu-speaking people) Muslim refugees from India,[32] coupled with a substantial exodus 
                of its Hindu residents, whose numbers declined from 51.1% to 1.7% of the total population.[33][34] The city experienced rapid economic growth following Pakistan's independence, attracting migrants from 
                throughout the country and other regions in South Asia.[35] According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, Karachi's total population was 16,051,521, with 14.9 million of those people residing in the urban areas 
                of the city. Karachi is one of the world's fastest-growing cities,[36] and has significant communities representing almost every ethnic group in Pakistan. Karachi holds more than two million Bengali immigrants,
                a million Afghan refugees, and up to 400,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar.[37][38][39]

                Karachi is now Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre. The city has a formal economy estimated to be worth $190 billion as of 2021, which is the largest in the country.[40][41] Karachi collects 
                35% of Pakistan's tax revenue,[42] and generates approximately 25% of Pakistan's entire GDP.[43][44] Approximately 30% of Pakistani industrial output is from Karachi,[45] while Karachi's ports handle 
                approximately 95% of Pakistan's foreign trade.[46] Approximately 90% of the multinational corporations and 100% of banks operating in Pakistan are headquartered in Karachi.[46] Karachi is considered to be 
                Pakistan's fashion capital,[47][48] and has hosted the annual Karachi Fashion Week since 2009.[49][50]

                Known as the "City of Lights" in the 1960s and 1970s for its vibrant nightlife,[51] Karachi was beset by sharp ethnic, sectarian, and political conflict in the 1980s with the large-scale arrival of weaponry 
                during the Soviet–Afghan War.[52] The city had become well known for its high rates of violent crime, but recorded crimes sharply decreased following a crackdown operation against criminals, the MQM political 
                party, and Islamist militants, initiated in 2013 by the Pakistan Rangers.[53] As a result of the operation, Karachi dropped from being ranked the world's 6th-most dangerous city for crime in 2014, to 
                128th by 2022.[54]

                Before independence, the city was widely known as Karanchi in Urdu, though the English spelling Karachi became more popular over time.[55]</p>

                Modern Karachi was reputedly founded in 1729 as the settlement of Kolachi-jo-Goth during the rule of Kalhora dynasty.[30] The new settlement is said to have been named in honour of Mai Kolachi, whose son is said to have slain a 
                man-eating crocodile in the village after his elder brothers had already been killed by it.[30] The name Karachee, a shortened and corrupted version of the original name Kolachi-jo-Goth, was used for the first time in a Dutch 
                report from 1742 about a shipwreck near the settlement.[56][57]

                The region around Karachi has been the site of human habitation for millennia. Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic sites have been excavated in the Mulri Hills along Karachi's northern outskirts. These earliest inhabitants 
                are believed to have been hunter-gatherers, with ancient flint tools discovered at several sites.</p>

            <p>
                The expansive Karachi region is believed to have been known to the ancient Greeks, and may have been the site of Barbarikon, an ancient seaport which was located at the nearby mouth of the Indus River.[58][59][60][61] Karachi may also have 
                been referred to as Ramya in ancient Greek texts.[62]</p>
            <p>
                The ancient site of Krokola, a natural harbor west of the Indus where Alexander the Great sailed his fleet for Achaemenid Assyria, may have been located near the mouth of Karachi's Malir River,[63][64][65] though some believe it was located 
                near Gizri.[66][67] No other natural harbor exists near the mouth of the Indus that could accommodate a large fleet.[68] Nearchus, who commanded Alexander's naval fleet, also mentioned a hilly island by the name of Morontobara and an 
                adjacent flat island named Bibakta, which colonial historians identified as Karachi's Manora Point and Kiamari (or Clifton), respectively, based on Greek descriptions.[69][70][71] Both areas were island until well into the colonial era, 
                when silting in led to them being connected to the mainland.[72]</p>
            <p>  
                In 711 CE, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered the Sindh and Indus Valley and the port of Debal, from where he launched his forces further into the Indus Valley in 712.[73] Some have identified the port with Karachi, though some argue the location 
                was somewhere between Karachi and the nearby city of Thatta.[74][75]
            <p>
                Under Mirza Ghazi Beg, the Mughal administrator of Sindh, the development of coastal Sindh and the Indus River Delta was encouraged. Under his rule, fortifications in the region acted as a bulwark against Portuguese incursions into Sindh. 
                In 1553–54, Ottoman admiral Seydi Ali Reis, mentioned a small port along the Sindh coast by the name of Kaurashi which may have been Karachi.[76][77][78] The Chaukhandi tombs in Karachi's modern suburbs were built around this time between the 15th and 18th centuries.
