            <b>Karachi is the capital of the Pakistani province of Sindh.</b> Situated on the Arabian Sea, 
               Karachi serves as a transport hub, and is home to Pakistan's two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi 
               and Port Bin Qasim, as well as the busiest airport in Pakistan. Though the Karachi region has been inhabited 
               for millennia, the city was founded as the fortified village of Kolachi in 1729.
        </p>

        <p>
            Karachi is one of the world's fastest growing cities, and has communities representing almost every ethnic group in Pakistan.
        </p>

        <p>
            Karachi is built on a coastal plains with scattered rocky outcroppings, hills and coastal marshlands. Coastal mangrove forests 
            grow in the brackish waters around the Karachi Harbour, and farther southeast towards the expansive Indus River Delta. 
            West of Karachi city is the Cape Monze, locally known as Ras Muari, which is an area characterised by sea cliffs, rocky sandstone 
            promontories and undeveloped beaches.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within the city of Karachi are two small ranges: the Khasa Hills and Mulri Hills, which lie in the northwest and act as a barrier 
            between North Nazimabad Town and Orangi Town. Karachi's hills are barren and are part of the larger Kirthar Range, and have a maximum 
            elevation of 528 metres (1,732 feet).

                Revenue collection
                </h2>
            

            <p>
                As home to Pakistan's largest ports and a large portion of its manufacturing base, Karachi contributes a large share of Pakistan's collected tax revenue. 
                As most of Pakistan's large multinational corporations are based in Karachi, income taxes are paid in the city even though income may be generated from 
                other parts of the country.<sup>[175]</sup> As home to the country's two largest ports, Pakistani customs officials collect the bulk of federal duty and tariffs at 
                Karachi's ports, even if those imports are destined for one of Pakistan's other provinces.<sup></sup>[176]</sup> Approximately 25% of Pakistan's national revenue is generated 
                in Karachi.<sup>[43]</sup>

               According to the Federal Board of Revenue's 2006/2007 year book, tax and customs units in Karachi were responsible for 46.75% of direct taxes, 33.65% of federal excise tax, 
               and 23.38% of domestic sales tax.<sup>[177]</sup> Karachi accounts for 75.14% of customs duty and 79% of sales tax on imports,<sup>[177]</sup> and collects 53.38% of the total collections of the 
               Federal Board of Revenue, of which 53.33% are customs duty and sales tax on imports.<sup>[177][178]</sup>

            Ethnicity
           </h2>
           <p>
            The oldest portions of modern Karachi reflect the ethnic composition of the first settlement, with Balochis and Sindhis continuing to make up a large portion of the Lyari neighbourhood,<sup>[25]</sup> 
            though many of the residents are relatively recent migrants. Following Partition, large numbers of Hindus left Pakistan for the newly independent Dominion of India (later the Republic of India), 
            while a larger percentage of Muslim migrant and refugees from India settled in Karachi. The city grew 150% during the ten period between 1941 and 1951 with the new arrivals from India,<sup>[191]</sup> 
            who made up 57% of Karachi's population in 1951.<sup>[192]</sup> The city is now considered a melting pot of Pakistan and is the country's most diverse city.[25]</sup>
            Karachi is the largest Bengali speaking city outside Bengal region.
            In 2011, an estimated 2.5 million foreign migrants lived in the city, mostly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka.<sup>[193]</sup>
